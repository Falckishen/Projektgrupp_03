How to run the game: 
  1. Compile game into jar file, this can be done in intellij by going to the maven bar on the right and going into Maven settings, symbolised by a wrench, going into the sub section "Runner" and activating "Delegate IDE build/run actions to Maven", then building using the standard intellij build button.
  2. Open the built jar file path in a terminal, this can be done by right clicking the file "topdownshooter-1.0.0.jar" that should appear in the "target" folder after building, clicking "Open in" -> Terminal and then inputting "java -jar topdownshooter-1.0.0.jar" into the terminal.

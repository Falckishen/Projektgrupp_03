How to run the game: 
  1. Compile game into jar file, this can be done in intellij by going to the maven bar on the right and going into Maven settings, which is the wrench Napster the fucking wrench, going into the sub section "Runner" and activating "Delegate IDE build/run actions to Maven", then building using the standard intellij build button.
  2. Open the built jar file path in a terminal, this can be done by right clicking the file "topdownshooter-1.0.0.jar" that should appear in the "target" folder after building, clicking "Open in" -> Terminal and then inputting "java -jar topdownshooter-1.0.0.jar" into the terminal.
